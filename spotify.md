<p class="articletext"> We scrapped the top 100 Youtube charts since 2016 from over 60 countries and analyzed their main musical characteristics using Spotify's API. The API provides informations on various aspects such as the song's length, key, tempo and loudness, as well as pre-made metrics such as "danceability", "acousticnes" or "valence", which describes the felt sadness/hapiness of the song. The following diagram details the way our data was acquired and structured.</p>

<p class="articletext"> Our objective was ultimately to create a model capable of predicting the popularity of any given song in various countries, and at different timescale. This model could serve as tool for market analysis, to guide the promotional campaign of upcoming artists. Before building the model, I was tasked with developping visualizations to help our team better grasp the dataset, and find interesting trends and correlations. </p>
